# Google OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

### 1. **Authorization Request**
   - The client directs the user to Google's Authorization Server.
   - The server presents the user with a consent screen to approve access to specific resources.
   - Upon approval, the server returns an authorization code to the client.

### 2. **Authorization Code Exchange**
   - The microservice sends the authorization code to Google’s Authorization Server along with client credentials.
   - Google responds with an access token (and optionally a refresh token) if the request is valid.

### 3. **Access Protected Resources**
   - The microservice uses the access token to make authorized requests to Google’s APIs, such as Gmail, Calendar, or Drive.

## Advantages of the Authorization Code Flow
1. **Security:**
   - Sensitive tokens are not exposed to the client or browser.
2. **Token Refresh:**
   - The refresh token enables the microservice to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to reauthenticate.
3. **Compatibility:**
   - Works seamlessly with Google’s APIs and ensures compliance with OAuth 2.0 standards.

This implementation demonstrates a secure and efficient way to integrate Google OAuth into Java-based microservices, ensuring both security and functionality for accessing protected resources.
