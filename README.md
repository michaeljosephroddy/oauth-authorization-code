# Google OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

This documentation outlines the implementation of a Java microservice that uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow to authenticate and authorize with Google services. The Authorization Code grant type is ideal for confidential and public clients, securely exchanging an authorization code for an access token.

---

## Overview
The Authorization Code Flow is a widely used approach for server-side web applications. It ensures sensitive tokens, such as access tokens, are securely exchanged between the Authorization Server (Google) and the microservice without exposing them to the client.

## Key Steps

### 1. **Authorization Request**
   - The client directs the user to Google's Authorization Server.
   - The server presents the user with a consent screen to approve access to specific resources.
   - Upon approval, the server returns an authorization code to the client.

### 2. **Authorization Code Exchange**
   - The microservice sends the authorization code to Google’s Authorization Server along with client credentials.
   - Google responds with an access token (and optionally a refresh token) if the request is valid.

### 3. **Access Protected Resources**
   - The microservice uses the access token to make authorized requests to Google’s APIs, such as Gmail, Calendar, or Drive.

## Advantages of the Authorization Code Flow
1. **Security:**
   - Sensitive tokens are not exposed to the client or browser.
2. **Token Refresh:**
   - The refresh token enables the microservice to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to reauthenticate.
3. **Compatibility:**
   - Works seamlessly with Google’s APIs and ensures compliance with OAuth 2.0 standards.

This implementation demonstrates a secure and efficient way to integrate Google OAuth into Java-based microservices, ensuring both security and functionality for accessing protected resources.
